# Tags and themes API

Sources: `internal/handlers/song_tag.go`, `theme_pack.go`, `theme_pack_catalog.go`, and `internal/app/routers.go`. Field definitions are in `docs/swagger.json`. Every interface requires a Bearer token.

Tags link to songs through `song_tag_links` and do not replace `genre` / `style`. Theme packs are declarative JSON. Catalog installation and manual import share validation; separate endpoints manage the active pack.
